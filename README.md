# Update Homebrew Formula

A GitHub Action that synchronizes a Homebrew formula with a GitHub release.

> ðŸš§ This is still in development, and not ready for general use.

Add this action to a workflow
to update a corresponding [Homebrew formula](https://brew.sh) in your tap repository
whenever you create a new [GitHub release](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/about-releases).
Your Homebrew formula will be updated with the tag and revision of the release.
Any assets associated with the release whose name matches the
[expected pattern](https://github.com/NSHipster/update-homebrew-formula-action/blob/e1551f21a97c71feba4202ab613f460f008807cb/entrypoint.rb#L65)
will be added as pre-built binary artifacts,
or [bottles](https://www.rubydoc.info/github/Homebrew/brew/Formula#bottle-class_method).

To better understand what this action does and why it's useful,
consider the following scenario:

* * *

Mona has a project `mona/hello` with source code
for building an executable named `hello`.
To make it easier to install,
Mona provides the following Homebrew [formula](https://docs.brew.sh/Formula-Cookbook)
in a [tap](https://docs.brew.sh/Formula-Cookbook#homebrew-terminology)
that she hosts in a repository named `mona/homebrew-formulae`:

```ruby
class Hello < Formula
  desc "ðŸ‘‹"
  homepage "https://github.com/mona/hello"
  url "https://github.com/mona/hello.git", tag: "1.0.0", revision: "d95b2990f6186523cda25cea4f9d45bc1fde069f"

  depends_on xcode: ["12.0", :build]

  def install
    system "make", "install", "prefix=#{prefix}"
  end

  test do
    system bin/"hello"
  end
end
```

This allows anyone with Homebrew installed
to install the `hello` command with a single command:

```terminal
$ brew install mona/formulae/hello
```

However, this convenience for the user comes at a cost to Mona
(beyond the fixed cost of creating a formula in the first place).
Whenever Mona wants to release a new version of `hello`,
she must do the following:

- [x] Create and push a new tag
- [x] Create a new release on GitHub
- [x] Build and upload a pre-built binary for the release
- [x] Calculate the SHA256 checksum for the binary
- [x] Update the Homebrew formula with the new tag, revision,
      and asset checksums

If she forgets to do all of these steps
(or makes a mistake),
her users won't get the latest version when they install `hello`.

This action automates the manual, error-prone process described above,
streamlining the release of any tool you distribute via
your own Homebrew tap.

Let's say Mona tags a new `1.0.1` version
after setting up a workflow [like the one described below](#usage).
When `update-homebrew-formula-action` runs,
it updates the formula with a new tag and revision:

```diff
  class Hello < Formula
    desc "ðŸ‘‹"
    homepage "https://github.com/mona/hello"
-   url "https://github.com/mona/hello.git", tag: "1.0.0", revision: "d95b2990f6186523cda25cea4f9d45bc1fde069f"
+   url "https://github.com/mona/hello.git", tag: "1.0.1", revision: "5aa05bf843ef74f6c3e5ed6d504d6f305e0945d1"
```

### Example Workflows

#### Updating a Homebrew formula in response to creating a new release

We recommend running this action as part of a workflow that triggers on
[release events](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#release)
with the `created` activity type.
This way, any release that's created â€”
whether manually or programmatically
(such as with [actions/create-release](https://github.com/actions/create-release)) â€”
will benefit from the same automation.

```yml
# .github/workflows/release.yml
name: Release

on:
  release:
    types:
      - created

jobs:
  formula:
    name: Update Homebrew formula
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Update the Homebrew formula with latest release
        uses: NSHipster/update-homebrew-formula-action@main
        with:
          repository: mona/hello
          tap: mona/homebrew-formulae
          formula: Formula/hello.rb
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

> **Important**:
> A workflow run can trigger other workflow runs
> _only_ if you use a personal access token other than `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
> For more information,
> see "Triggering new workflows using a personal access token"
> in the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#triggering-new-workflows-using-a-personal-access-token).

#### Updating a formula with a bottle

For extra credit,
you can extend your workflow to create a release for the new tag
and build bottles once the formula is updated.
It's a bit involved,
but your users will appreciate your going the extra mile.

Here's the order of operations:

1. Update the formula for the latest release, like before
2. Once that's finished,
   use Homebrew to build a bottle using the updated formula.
3. Upload the bottle to the release on GitHub
4. Update the formula again, this time to add the bottle

```yml
# .github/workflows/release.yml
name: Release

on:
  release:
    types:
      - created

jobs:
  formula:
    name: Update Homebrew formula
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Update the Homebrew formula with latest release
        uses: NSHipster/update-homebrew-formula-action@main
        with:
          repository: mona/hello
          tap: mona/homebrew-formulae
          formula: Formula/hello.rb
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  bottle:
    name: Build and distribute Homebrew bottle for macOS Catalina
    runs-on: macos-10.15
    needs: [formula]
    steps:
      - name: Build a bottle using Homebrew
        run: |
          brew tap mona/homebrew-formulae
          brew install --build-bottle --verbose hello
          brew bottle hello
      - name: Upload the bottle to the GitHub release
        uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1.0.1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          upload_url: ${{ github.event.release.upload_url }}
          asset_path: ./hello--${{ github.event.release.tag_name }}.catalina.bottle.tar.gz
          asset_name: hello-${{ github.event.release.tag_name }}.catalina.bottle.tar.gz
          asset_content_type: application/gzip
      - name: Update the Homebrew formula again with bottle
        uses: NSHipster/update-homebrew-formula-action@main
        with:
          repository: mona/hello
          tap: mona/homebrew-formulae
          formula: Formula/hello.rb
          message: |
              Add bottle for hello ${{ github.event.release.tag_name }}
              on macOS Catalina
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

> **Note**:
> Homebrew generates bottles with a double dash (`--`) in the resulting filename,
> but expects a single dash (`-`) when downloading the bottle.

After running this workflow,
your formula will have a `bottle` declaration like the following:

```diff
+   bottle do
+     root_url "https://github.com/mona/hello/releases/download/1.0.1"
+     cellar :any
+     sha256 "d7493440a64c3a11fac793fb0f28a21e6974e1f430fe246d603496b61a565ae9" => :catalina
+   end
```
